# Simon-Says variation for ATtiny1626 based board

As a part of the university project I have developed a variation of Simon-Says for QUTy board with ATtiny1626 microcontroller.
QUTy Homepage: https://cab202.github.io/quty/

The game utilises:
- 4 vertical sections of the 2-digit, 7-segment LED display to display light signals, each corresponding with a unique audio tone.
- 4 pushbuttons which allign with the light segments and audio tones, for the user to input the sequence
- potentiometer to adjust playback speed
